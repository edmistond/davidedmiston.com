Finally decided to get off of the Wordpress train here and move my blog over to a static site generator. After looking at a couple of different options, I decided to give [Hexo](http://hexo.io) a try and see how it worked out. Fairly happy with it so far - it seems to have very sensible defaults out of the box.

Could've gone with Middleman (used it on professional projects in the past) or Hugo, but I wanted to go with something a little different and something that didn't require me to install Pygments to get working syntax highlighting. It's a perfectly fine package to work with, but I currently do little or no Python and didn't really feel like taking the time to get `pip` set up to install Pygments properly. Laziness is sometimes a virtue. :)
