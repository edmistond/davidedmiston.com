This weekend marked the tenth and final instance of the [Kalamazoo X Conference](http://kalamazoox.org/); the first time I heard about the conference was in early 2014. I asked my wife what she thought about it and she said "I think that would be a **great** conference for you." The registration was super reasonably priced, so I bought a ticket and there I was a few months later. My wife, as she often is, was right&mdash;it was a great conference... and I've been back four more times since.

All good things must come to an end, so I can't really fault [Michael Eaton](https://twitter.com/mjeaton) and the rest of the KalX team for deciding that it was time to hang it up after ten years. Though I've no personal experience with doing so, I'm sure the effort of organizing a conference year after year is exhausting, and I'm deeply appreciative of the time and effort that they've put into doing so. And of course, that's not even getting into all the effort that various speakers&mdash;particularly multi-repeat speakers like [Jay Harris](https://twitter.com/jayharris)&mdash;put into writing and polishing their talks.

It's hard to explain KalX. The audience is primarily technical people, particularly software devs. But at the same time, I don't think I've ever seen a talk here that actually got into a technical topic. The closest I can think of would be H. Alan Stevens' "Values Driven Development" talk at KalX 2015, and even that was mainly about process and people and not in-depth technical subjects.

I think this sums it up best:

Every year, I come away from Kalamazoo feeling inspired and challenged; the hardest thing about the conference is getting home and asking yourself: "Okay, now how do I apply what I've learned?" I'm not always as successful at that part as I'd like to be, but as Jay Harris advised us last year... you give yourself permission to f*** up.

Anyway... to my 2018 recap. I'll try to do these justice, but since I couldn't always hear the speakers well and often used other people's live tweeting to help fill in some of the gaps, the message may have gotten a little lost in translation.

First up, we had [Jay Harris](http://twitter.com/jayharris) talking about perfection, and why it's bullshit. His emoji slides are always kind of amusing, as is his deadpan delivery. He kind of alluded back to last year's talks as well, when he talked about giving yourself permission to fuck up. I think my biggest take-away here was essentially&mdash;as Jay put it&mdash;we strive for perfection but it doesn't make us better, it makes us miserable. Don't aim for "good enough" as an alternative since that's still implying something about perfection; just aim to be able to say "this is good."

The second talk of the morning was [Jon Mills](https://twitter.com/jonathanfmills) with "Two Kinds of People"&mdash;starting off with a bunch of "two kinds of people" jokes and then seguing from that into a discussion of how those jokes are really an example of us vs. them thinking. From there, it drew somewhat on the current political climate in the United States as well as Daryl Davis' work in engaging with members of the KKK to improve race relations. Biggest take-away here: if we only surround ourselves with people who agree with us, we eventually become dumber. There aren't two types of people, there's 7 billion of them&mdash;but really, there's only one: us.

The third talk of the day: [Heather Downing](https://twitter.com/quorralyne) discussing how "Technology is easy, people are hard." This was the talk today that resonated with me the most. She really got into various aspects of leadership, dealing with people, and especially the need for empathy&mdash;and how you can deal with some of this in the context of a professional relationship. A favorite (rough) quote: *If you look at it like "I'm not a people person, I'm a human detective" - it's more fun!* Also some great suggestions on thinking about your language and tone in leadership situations; for example, rather than saying "you're behind everyone else," maybe try asking "hey, you're usually getting more done, is anything wrong?" I think my key takeaway here is the need for empathy and that you're in control of how people connect with you. "Focus on people first, care about the first, and accomplishments will follow."

This talk stood out so strongly to me in part because I've really been thinking a lot lately about what I want the next decade of my career to look like&mdash;and in the process of doing that, I've been wondering if perhaps solving people and team challenges would be more interesting than solving tech challenges. For that matter, I wonder if it might not ultimately leave more room to make an impact, too.
