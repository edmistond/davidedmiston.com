Currently, I'm open to taking on a few after-hours side projects and would be happy to make time to talk to you. If you have a full time role involving new challenges and new opportunities that you think I'd be a good fit for, I'd also be happy to talk to you. Please take a look at my <a href="<%- url_for('/About/') %>">about me</a> page for the sorts of opportunities that I'm excited about, then [shoot me an email](mailto:edmistond@gmail.com).

From a technical standpoint, though I'm open to most things, I am trying to spend less time these days working with .NET (my current employer is migrating away from it), though I *would* be intrigued by an opportunity to work with .NET Core developed and deployed on non-Windows platforms.
