Though I'm currently happily employed, I do occasionally take on after-hours side projects and would be happy to make time to talk to you. Please take a look at my <a href="<%- url_for('/About/') %>">about me</a> page for the sorts of opportunities that I'm excited about.

From a technical standpoint, though I'm open to most things, I am trying to spend less time these days working with .NET (my current employer is migrating away from it), though I *would* be intrigued by an opportunity to work with .NET Core developed and deployed on non-Windows platforms.
