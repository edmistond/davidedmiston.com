I'm David, often [found](http://www.twitter.com/edmistond) [online](http://www.github.com/edmistond) as edmistond.

I'm an experienced polyglot developer who's worked across the entire stack in a variety of languages. Some highlights of my experience include...
* Creating client-side web applications using XMLHttpRequest before "AJAX" was even a thing
* Building and maintaining building and maintaining telecom online order systems handling thousands of orders monthly
* Building a variety of marketing campaign applications for a major telecom, including challenges like mitigating fraudulent sweeps entries
* Parachuting into new projects using languages or frameworks I wasn't deeply familiar with and contributing business value quickly
* Remediating and reviving large legacy .NET projects where the original team was no longer available, getting them to a point where the company could decide how to move forward with them

I'm happiest when I'm working on interesting, challenging technical problems that offer me opportunities to...
* Mentor less-experienced developers and help them level up
* Learn new technical skills, such as a new-to-me language or framework
* Learn about a new business domain
* Have a significant business impact
