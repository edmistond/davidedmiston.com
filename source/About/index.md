I'm David, often [found](http://www.twitter.com/edmistond) [online](http://www.github.com/edmistond) as edmistond.

I'm an experienced polyglot developer who's worked across the entire stack in a variety of languages. Some highlights of my experience:

During my co-op in college at a Fortune 1000 company, I first learned to appreciate the usefulness of web applications. While co-oping, I helped to build a Material Safety Data Sheet lookup application and was the assistant webmaster of the customer facing website. I first started learning how to do ETL operations&mdash;sometimes literally, like when I had to type in our entire collection of product catalogs because we didn't have the data in a digital format at the time.

After finishing with the straight HTML work, I got involved in building the company's B2B portal and continued in that capacity after I graduated college and joined the company full time. That project involved some stuff that was really cutting edge for the time; client-side rendering using XSLT and XMLHttpRequest before "AJAX" was even a thing, print-specific CSS layouts (uncommon at the time) and a really weird n-tier ASP/VB COM/Oracle setup. Our customers loved it. I also led an internal project, collaborating with another developer and a member of the organization's design group, to redesign the company's internal web site and bring it up to modern (for the time!) standards.

Eventually, I moved on to my current employer, where I've been for quite some time now and have had a variety of roles that have given me different challenges. I started out by getting up to speed quickly on C# (after working with Visual Basic.NET for several years prior) and contributing features to our product almost from my week there. Eventually I moved into a professional services role where I worked closely with several of our telecom clients (as well as several of our wonderful project managers) in tackling a bunch of challenges. I wrote numerous web applications supporting various sweepstakes and marketing campaigns; these included a number of very interesting challenges: detecting attempts to cheat with multiple entries, identifying and mitigating common classes of user errors such as incorrect email address entry, and building heavily interactive client-side applications (mostly in jQuery) backed by ASP.NET Web API backends.

Apart from that, I also worked with several clients to build online order applications for cable TV/Internet/phone bundles - in ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC, and eventually, in node.js. All of these applications had their own rewarding challenges and things to learn from: structuring SOAP messages in the process of interacting with the CableLabs web serivces, data serialization, maintaining application state even in the face of unexpected user behavior, and adding unit testing to an existing node.js application that was in sore need of them, just to name a few. Whenever possible, I would also attempt to introduce improvements to our engineering practices: advocating for better source control (git), building scripts to create and automatically upload delta deployments of client applications <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>, or introducing database migrations to make application deployments faster and more reliable.

Most recently, I was assigned to a small team that was working to revitalize a very complicated legacy .NET Web Forms application for which the original development team was no longer with the company; this entailed getting the complicated build process functional again and documenting it, upgrading to newer versions of some of the dependencies, and in general, spending a lot of time working with the rest of the team to determine how various functionality worked and needed to be configured. This was ultimately successful, and we got the application into a position where we are again able to support it.

I've found that I'm happiest working on interesting, challenging technical problems that offer me opportunities to:
* Mentor less experienced developers, helping them to realize their potential and level up their skills
* Acquire new skills, such as a new-to-me language or framework
* Learn about new business domains
* Have a significant and positive impact on the organization

Outside of the office, I make an effort to be involved with the technical community in Cleveland, attending a couple of meetups, and can be frequently found in both the Cleveland Tech Slack group as well as the Deaf Professionals Slack group. On a personal level, I have interests in photography and make an effort to spend time with my family.

<a name="footnote1">[1]</a> This was necessary for compliance with a client requirement that we only deploy files which had changed, rather than the entire application codebase.
